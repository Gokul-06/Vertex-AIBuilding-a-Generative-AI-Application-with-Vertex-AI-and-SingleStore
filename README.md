# AI Live Stock Data Development with Vertex AI and SingleStoreDB

Objective: Develop an AI-powered application using Vertex AI for machine learning model management and SingleStoreDB for high-speed, scalable data handling.

Key Features:

Environment Setup: Initialize a development environment equipped with essential tools for AI application development.
Data Handling: Engage in data exploration, cleansing, and preparation to set the stage for the AI model.
Data Storage with SingleStoreDB: Utilize SingleStoreDB's capabilities for efficient data storage and management, ensuring quick access and high performance.
Machine Learning with Vertex AI: Leverage Vertex AI to process the data swiftly, facilitating rapid insight generation and model training.
AI-Powered QA System: Construct an intelligent question-answering system capable of providing precise responses to user queries.

Getting Started:

Setup Installation:
Install necessary libraries: gcloud, langchain, google-cloud-aiplatform, singlestoredb.
Command: pip install gcloud langchain google-cloud-aiplatform singlestoredb
Model Integration:
Incorporate live stock data into the model, enabling real-time data analysis and response generation.
Utilize a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach for enhancing the model's ability to fetch and integrate external data for answering queries.
This framework not only sets the groundwork for your AI application but also ensures that it is equipped to handle large volumes of data efficiently and provide intelligent, data-driven insights. Your approach of combining Vertex AI’s machine learning prowess with SingleStoreDB’s efficient data management is strategic, ensuring that your AI system is both robust and agile.
